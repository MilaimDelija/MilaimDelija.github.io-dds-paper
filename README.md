Dynamic Data Science Framework
"Redefining Data Science: A Dynamic, Context-Aware, and Self-Learning Framework"
Milaim Delija, 2025

ðŸ“„ Abstract
Traditional data science methods, which rely mostly on static models and fixed analytical approaches, struggle with the complexities of today's fast-changing digital world. This research presents Dynamic Data Science (DDS), a new framework that brings together temporal data flows, contextual understanding, adaptive feedback, and error handling in a unified system. Through empirical analysis, mathematical modeling, and simulation experiments, we show that DDS delivers better predictive performance and real-time decision capabilities than existing methods.

ðŸ§® Mathematical Framework
The core DDS equation integrates multiple data streams:
D(t) = Î±(t)Â·X(t) + Î²(t)Â·C(t) + Î³(t)Â·F(t) - Î´(t)Â·E(t)
Where:

X(t): Primary data streams
C(t): Contextual information
F(t): Feedback from previous decisions
E(t): Errors, noise, and unexpected events
Î±, Î², Î³, Î´: Time-varying learned weights
