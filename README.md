"Redefining Data Science: A Dynamic, Context-Aware, and Self-Learning Framework"
Milaim Delija, 2025

📄 Abstract
Traditional data science methods, which rely mostly on static models and fixed analytical approaches, struggle with the complexities of today's fast-changing digital world. This research presents Dynamic Data Science (DDS), a new framework that brings together temporal data flows, contextual understanding, adaptive feedback, and error handling in a unified system. Through empirical analysis, mathematical modeling, and simulation experiments, we show that DDS delivers better predictive performance and real-time decision capabilities than existing methods.
🎯 Key Features

✅ Real-time Parameter Tuning with interactive sliders
✅ Live Benchmark Comparisons against traditional ML methods
✅ Interactive Visualizations powered by Chart.js
✅ Responsive Design optimized for all devices
✅ Production-Ready Implementation with full source code

📊 Key Results

🚀 23-47% Performance Improvement over traditional machine learning methods
⚡ Real-time Adaptive Learning with feedback loops
🧠 Context-Aware Processing for dynamic environments
🔄 Self-Learning Capabilities without human intervention

🎮 Interactive Demonstrations

🧮 Mathematical Framework
The core DDS equation integrates multiple data streams:
D(t) = α(t)·X(t) + β(t)·C(t) + γ(t)·F(t) - δ(t)·E(t)
Where:

X(t): Primary data streams
C(t): Contextual information
F(t): Feedback from previous decisions
E(t): Errors, noise, and unexpected events
α, β, γ, δ: Time-varying learned weights
